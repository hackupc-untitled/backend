# GNSS Data Visualization App (Backend)

Welcome to the backend section of our GNSS Data Visualization App, a solution crafted for the Hackathon UPC challenge sponsored by the European Space Agency (ESA). Our backend is designed to seamlessly integrate with the frontend, providing robust functionality for processing and serving GNSS data. Powered by Flask, our backend ensures efficient data handling and smooth communication with the frontend Flutter application.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Our backend fetches GNSS data from the GNSS library, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for visualization.
- **API Endpoints**: We provide well-defined API endpoints for the frontend to access GNSS data, facilitating seamless communication between the frontend and backend components.
- **Data Processing**: The backend performs necessary data processing tasks to prepare GNSS data for visualization, including filtering and formatting.
- **Real-time Communication**: Through Flask's capabilities, our backend supports real-time updates, enabling users to receive timely data insights.
